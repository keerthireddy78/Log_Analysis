# Log Analysis Project

This project is built to extract and organize logs for a specific device from multiple `.log` files. These logs are generated by enterprise apps running on Multifunction Printers (MFPs).

##  What It Does

- Reads multiple log files (Impl, HP Omni, JQuery).
- Takes a device serial number as input.
- Filters all log lines related to that device.
- Identifies full SOAP/XML blocks and login/logout events.
- Outputs all relevant logs into one file sorted by time.

##  Input Files

- A folder containing `.log` files.
- A file called `Serial_Numbers.txt` (contains serial â†” token mapping).
- Device serial number (entered by user when running the script).

## Output

- A single `.log` file named like `<DEVICE_ID>_all_related.log` containing all logs related to that device.
